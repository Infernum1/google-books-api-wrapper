Welcome to Google Books API Wrapper's documentation!
====================================================

**google-books-api-wrapper** is a python web api wrapper for the Google Books api. I developed this mostly for using the unauthenticated requests for searching books and getting their relevant details.
This includes the authors, official title and subtitles, Publication date, Publisher, Genre, etc. Test
